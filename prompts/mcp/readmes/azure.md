#### Tool: **`azmcp-extension-azd`**
Use this tool to always run all Azure Developer CLI (azd) commands. Most common activities will be helping users initialize projects, manage environments, provision and deploy infrastructure and apps to their Azure environment. If an azure.yaml file exists in the workspace, treat it as an existing azd project; otherwise, use init to create one. Always pass --cwd with the full workspace path, and use -e to specify the environment when required. Confirm with the user before performing destructive operations. After each command, suggest next steps if available, and ask before proceeding. On errors, prompt for missing info and retry. Be concise and contextual, using data from the user's environment and workspace to provide accurate, actionable responses. This tool can create, modify or delete resources in Azure. Always warn and confirm action with the user before performing destructive commands like 'up', 'down', 'provision' or 'deploy'.
